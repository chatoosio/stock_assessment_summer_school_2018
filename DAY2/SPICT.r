#The two top plots come from plotspict.data, with the dashed horizontal line representing a guess of MSY.
#This guess comes from a linear regression between the index and the catch divided by the index (middle row,left). This regression is expected to have a negative slope. A similar plot can be made showing catch versus catch/index (middle row, right) to approximately find the optimal effort (or effort proxy). The proportional increase in the index as a function of catch (bottom row, right) should show primarily positive increasesin index at low catches and vice versa. Positive increases in index at large catches could indicate model violations (Source SPICT Vignette)

# Short term forecast
#To make a catch forecast a forecast interval needs to be specified. This is done by specifying the start of the interval (inp$timepredc) and the length of the interval in years (inp$dtpredc). 

#For example, if a forecast of the annual catch of 2018 is of interest, then inp$timepredc = 2018 and inp$dtpredc = 1. 

#In addition to the forecast interval a fishing scenario needs to be specified. This is done by specifying a factor (inp$ffac) to multiply the current fishing mortality by (i.e. the F at the last time point of the time period where data are available) and the time that management should start (inp$manstart). 

#The time point of the reported forecast of biomass and fishing mortality can be controlled by setting inp$timepredi. Producing short-term forecasts entails minimal additional computing time.
